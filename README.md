# MANETSIP

This is a project exploring efficiency and security issues in the implementation of (P2P) SIP over a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network.

The code in this repository is for the OMNET++ simulator and has dependencies on the projects Oversim and inetmanet.

To install and use:
- install OMNET++ version 4.6 (see omnetpp.org where the software and install guide can be found).
- clone projects inetmanet-2.0 and oversim in your working directory (github repos also available from NMAI-lab).
- clone project MANETSIP into your working directory.
Import all three projects (file>import>general>existing projects into workspace) from the OMNET++ IDE.
- compile inetmanet (project > build project) then oversim, then MANETSIP (warning: it's slow, particularly for oversim).

- Yay. At this point the MANETSIP project doesn't have any working simulations. 
Hopefully I'll remember to update this when we get there.
